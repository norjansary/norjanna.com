		<p><center><b><em> Writing</em>- Writing helps me to express my thoughts, feelings, emotions and mood.<br> Even though, I’m an ambivert. 
		I still express myself better in writing.<br> When I’m sad, happy, or angry I write my thoughts down, when there is special and <br>memorable events or
		even just a normal day, I write what has happen to that day down. It’s serves as <br>my motivation, happiness, and passion. Journaling and diary is one of my favorites.</b></center></p>

		<p><center><b><em>Cooking and Baking</em>-Cooking or baking is one of my favorite thing to do, especially in <br>my free times,
		I get to cook, and I can  let others taste my food. I can eat, and I enjoy it more,<br>
		when I know I work hard on it, and it feels so fulfilling when my family says,<br> “You can make your own restaurant when you grow up”.</b></center></p>

		<p><center><em><b>Listening to Quran Recitation</em>-Listening to Quran and understanding the meaning of the words of my lord,<br>
		gives me guidance and reason why I’m I in this world. The Quran<br>
		has so much beauty in it. It lets me hear and read stories that no one has ever told me,<br>
		it gives me advice for a journey in a lifetime. Every time I finish studying, I listen <br>
		to Quran recitation because it soothes my mind and my heart, and it gives me calmness.</b></center></p>

		<p><center><b><em>Jogging</em>-When it is morning or when I feel stressed and feel I’m locked inside<br>
		our house, I go outside and take a jog with my mother or by myself and take a time to<br>
		enjoy the beauty of nature. Just seeing the green trees, cloudy and clear blue sky, breathing<br>
		on fresh air. It is simply one of my escapes out of my sadness. It always<br> 
		makes me go back every time. And turns out to be one of my habits.</b></center></p>
